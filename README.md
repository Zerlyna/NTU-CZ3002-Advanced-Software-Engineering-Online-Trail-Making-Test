Projection Description :

The Trail Making Test is a neuropsychological test of visual attention and task switching. It consists of two parts in which the subject is instructed to connect a set of 25 dots as quickly as possible while still maintaining accuracy. The test can provide information about visual search speed, scanning, speed of processing, mental flexibility, as well as executive functioning. It is sensitive to detecting cognitive impairment associated with dementia, for example, Alzheimer's disease.

The task requires a subject to connect a sequence of 25 consecutive targets on a sheet of paper or computer screen, in a similar manner to a child's connect-the-dots puzzle. There are two parts to the test: in the first, the targets are all numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.) and the test taker needs to connect them in sequential order; in the second part, the subject alternates between numbers and letters (1, A, 2, B, etc.). If the subject makes an error, the test administrator corrects them before the subject moves on to the next dot.

Note: 
This project only support strictly 1980x1080 resolution, due to no scaling adjustment not done on front-end development due to time constraint and more critical issues needed more attention. So please stop complaint about it being ugly when resolution is not ideal. Thanks!
